All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, 
CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding 
cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. Recipient accepts the terms and
conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned actions. The patent license
shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the time any related Modification is added, such addition
of the Modification causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent
license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Modification.
No patent license is provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by
Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code and Modifications not

Redistributions.

3.1.
Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in Exhibit A, below, must be
conspicuously retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code. For
distributions of the Covered Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that
can include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this License
must appear in related documentation or collateral where the Recipient's rights relating to
Covered Code are described. Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the
Original Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code.

3.2.
Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this
License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any of SGI's rights in and to the
Original Code, distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under
(1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are necessary
in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of
Recipient's choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that the license
terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be
modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license

other than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ
from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this
License is a limited license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original Code and
Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI in this License.

3.3.
Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI
as a result of any such alternative license terms Recipient offers.

4.
Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature,
must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

5.
No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to: (i) any
software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or licenses not expressly
granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code;
(ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any
related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered
Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original
Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly
granted under this License are reserved.

6.
Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws,
regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered Code, including without
limitation export, re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the
U.S. government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way
infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of any other
person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to
which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.

7.
Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any disposition
of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party's intellectual
property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8.
Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been
published under a particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the
license, continue to use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code
under the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of
Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
created under this License.

9.
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL
EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND

CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT SUBJECT TO THIS DISCLAIMER.

10.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NOR LEGAL
THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR
STRICT LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI
LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF
DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11.
Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or out of any representation or
warranty made by Recipient.

12.
U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" consisting of
"commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in title 48 of the Code of Federal
Regulations and all U.S. Government End Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License
and are subject to the terms of this License.

13.
Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the its
subject matter. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall
be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as possible the same legal and economic effect as the
original provision and the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California
between California residents. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent
subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with venue lying
exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
expressly excluded. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be

construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms 
and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented 
by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General 
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General 
Public License.

"The Library refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than 
an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the 
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass 
of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface 
provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application 
with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the 
Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the 
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for 
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the 
Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object 
code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility 
programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but 
excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without 
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility 
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the 
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), 
then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure 
that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the 
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains 
meaningful, or
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License 
applicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header 
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms 
of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to 
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, 
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of 
the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library 
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the 
Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging 
such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library 
is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license 
document.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, 
include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as 
a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license 
document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, 
and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under 
terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a 
modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, 
in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library 
already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly 
with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the 
Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be 
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only 
to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a 
modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking 
the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use 
option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal 
Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by 
section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by 
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not 
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined 
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the 
terms of this License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work 
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying 
uncombined form of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you 
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the 
option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser 
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether 
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that 
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent 
authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

Original Code or previous Modifications.

B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or previous 
Modifications.

1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code which is

indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by 
contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the 
outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. Source Code License.

2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, 
non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute 
the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as 
part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, 
to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions 
thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably 
necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) 
and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further 
Modifications or combinations.

2.2. Contributor Grant.
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive 
license, subject to third party intellectual property claims:

(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute 
the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on 
an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of 
a Larger Work; and

(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to 
Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the 
extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize 
the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent 
that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Application of License.
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by 
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The 
Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms 
of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 
6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any 
Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an 
additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2. Availability of Source Code.
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made 
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the 
same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version 
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must 
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially 
became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of 
that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You 
are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available 
even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3. Description of Modifications.
You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file 
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of 
any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is 
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial 
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source 
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation 
in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

(a) Third Party Claims.
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in 
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you 
must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" 
which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail 
that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge 
after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You 
shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available 
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing 
lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the 
Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

(b) Contributor APIs.
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or 
control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you 
must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

3.5. Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, 
and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe 
recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more 
Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice 
described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a 
particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such 
notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would 
be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a 
fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more 
recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make 
it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the 
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements 
of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a 
notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available 
under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You 
have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related 
documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating 
to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered 
Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from 
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the 
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial 
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial 
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not 
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a 
single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License 
with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation 
then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum 
extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. 
Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 
and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the 
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to 
understand it.

5. Application of this License.

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the 
notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1. New Versions.
Floris van den Berg may publish revised and/or new versions of the License 
from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2. Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the 
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. 
You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any 
subsequent version of the License published by Floris van den Berg
No one other than Floris van den Berg has the right to modify the terms 
applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3. Derivative Works.
If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only 
do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by 
this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases 
"FreeImage", `FreeImage Public License", "FIPL", or any confusingly similar 
phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear 
that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the 
FreeImage Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, 
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not 
of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK 
AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY 
COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER 
OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR 
OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF 
THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if 
You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 
days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code 
which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. 
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING 
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF 
SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR 
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH 
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL 
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND 
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and 
"commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users 
acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter 
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such 
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by Dutch law provisions (except 
to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its 
conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one 
party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business 
in, the The Netherlands: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes 
relating to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual 
property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the 
losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to 
this Agreement shall be held in Almelo, The Netherlands; and (c) any 
litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of 
the court of Almelo, The Netherlands with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys 
fees and expenses. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of 
a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this 
License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 
3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of 
Your utilization of rights under this License, based on the number of copies 
of Covered Code you made available, the revenues you received from utilizing 
such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to work with affected 
parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make 
sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially 
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software 
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we 
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, 
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have 
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want 
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free 
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors 
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These 
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute 
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a 
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must 
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link 
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the 
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms 
so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, 
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, 
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no 
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone 
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the 
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be 
affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free 
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the 
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent 
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version 
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in 
this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU 
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, 
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the 
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in 
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared 
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a 
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License 
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its 
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax 
criteria for linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less 
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It 
also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over 
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the 
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the 
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto 
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the 
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as 
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by 
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General 
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs 
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For 
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables 
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its 
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' 
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the 
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a 
modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification 
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the 
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived 
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in 
order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program 
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized 
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General 
Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as 
"you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so 
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of 
those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has 
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means 
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to 
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or 
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source 
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered 
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program 
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is 
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library 
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether 
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses 
the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may 
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, 
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you 
also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that 
you changed the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all 
third parties under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of 
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other 
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a 
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose 
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, 
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used 
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole 
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be 
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to 
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on 
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with 
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must 
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the 
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. 
(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License 
has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not 
make any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, 
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies 
and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library 
into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, 
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of 
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete 
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, 
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the 
object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but 
is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is 
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a 
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this 
License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an 
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions 
of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable 
is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution 
of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is 
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of 
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is 
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if 
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts 
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less 
in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of 
whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object 
code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the 
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables 
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are 
linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing 
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, 
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's 
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is 
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You 
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays 
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library 
among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this 
License. Also, you must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which 
must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an 
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work 
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user 
can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes 
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able 
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A 
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library 
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library 
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified 
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a 
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified 
materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or 
that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must 
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable 
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of 
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating 
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library 
together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not 
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided 
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the 
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do 
these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the 
Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be 
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of 
it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and 
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the 
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the 
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of 
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to 
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on 
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse 
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other 
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the 
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit 
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies 
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both 
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents 
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; 
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free 
software distribution system which is implemented by public license 
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or 
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original 
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an 
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so 
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. 
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later 
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of 
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software 
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may 
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the 
author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free 
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make 
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR 
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE 
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR 
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR 
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER 
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

only on Your own behalf and on Your sole and exclusive responsibility. You 
must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are 
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold the 
Initial Developer and any Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by

non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the 
Software is with You.


9. Liability

Under no circumstances shall You, the Initial Developer or any Contributor be 
liable to any person for any direct or indirect damages of any kind 
including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, loss of data, 
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction or any and all other 
commercial damages or losses resulting from or relating to this License or 
indirectly to the use of the Software.

12. Term

protection covered by the intellectual property rights applicable to the 
Original Code.


13. Termination

In case of termination, as provided in Section 3 above, You agree to 
immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, distribution 
and sublicensing of the Software and to destroy all copies of the Software 
that are in Your possession or control. All sublicenses of the Software which 
have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination 
of this License. In addition, Sections 5, 8 to 11, 13.2 and 15.2 of this 
License, in reason of their nature, shall survive the termination of this 
License for a period of fifteen (15) years.


14. Versions of the license

The Initial Developer may publish new versions of this License from time to 
time. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of 
this License, You may choose to continue to use it under the terms and 
conditions of that version or use the Original Code under the terms of any 
subsequent version of this License published by the Initial Developer.


15. Miscellaneous

15.1 Relationship of Parties

This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint 
venture or any other form of legal association between You and the Initial 
Developer, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by 
implication or otherwise.

15.2 Independent Development

Nothing in this License will impair the Initial Developer's right to acquire, 
license, develop, have others develop for it, market or distribute technology 
or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise 
compete with, Modifications, Derivative Programs, technology or products that 
You may develop, produce, market or distribute.

15.3 Severability

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of 
this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the 
License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect 
the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this 
License will continue in full force and extent.

                    The FreeType Project LICENSE
                    ----------------------------

                            2006-Jan-27

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
      specific licenses, porting, etc.

    License
THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE 
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT 
AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE 
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED 
HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions
    a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or 
        encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a 
        number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, 
        are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not 
        be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, 
        such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, 
        sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work 
        may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work 
        will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, 
        where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
        with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
    e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.   
    f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated 
        the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor 
        to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, 
first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights 
in the Work as stated below:
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as 
        incorporated in the Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of 
        a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of 
        a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
        i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually 
        or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital 
        performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually 
        or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create 
        from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of 
        the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, 
        Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society 
        (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the 
        compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights 
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the
        terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with 
        every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. 
        You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' 
        exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer 
        to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, 
        or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in 
        a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in 
        a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to 
        the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent 
        practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create 
        a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative 
        Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
    b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative 
        Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to 
        the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, 
        and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, 
        publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable 
        means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, 
        the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI 
        does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, 
        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original 
        Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any 
        reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such 
        credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as 
        such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS 
OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR 
OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS 
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU 
ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE 
OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the 
    terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You 
    under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain 
    in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the 
    applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under 
    different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will 
    not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms 
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the 
        recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a 
        license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the 
        validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties 
        to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid 
        and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent 
        shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. 
        There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall 
        not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be 
        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
